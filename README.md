### Requirements:
Any `OpenJDK 18` distribution as that's what it's been tested on. The latest version of `Maven` if you plan on fiddling with the source code and building the jar.

### How to run?
Navigate to the projects base directory and run:
```
java -jar target/HouseholdAnalyzer-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

```
mvn clean package
```
All changes to the directory structure will be handled in the `HouseholdAnalyzer` class.
